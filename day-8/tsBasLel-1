1. What are the basic data types in TypeScript?

TypeScript is like JavaScript but with types. It helps you avoid bugs by telling you what kind of data a variable should hold.

Basictypes -

1. number =>   Any number, like 5 or 3.14
2. string =>	Text values
3. boolean	=>	true/false
4. any	=>	Can be anything 
null =>	A value thatâ€™s empty
undefined => Not assigned
array => List of values
tuple => Fixed types in fixed order
