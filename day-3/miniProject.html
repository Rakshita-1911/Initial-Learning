                    <p>Learn how to use HTML and CSS to make webpages. HTML is the markup language that you surround content with, to tell browsers about headings, lists, tables, and more. CSS is the stylesheet language that you style the page with, to tell browsers to change the color, font, layout, and more.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><em>HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web.</em> It defines the basic elements of a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more. HTML uses a system of tags enclosed in angle brackets to organize content, allowing web browsers to interpret and display it properly. It forms the backbone of all websites and provides the foundational structure upon which other technologies like CSS and JavaScript build.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to web content, ensuring that websites look visually appealing and consistent across different devices. CSS separates content from design, making it easier to maintain and update a website's appearance without altering its underlying HTML structure.</p>

                    <h2>What you should already know</h2>
                    <p>Before diving into HTML and CSS, it's important to understand the basics of how the web works. When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to a web server, which responds with files—usually HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser reads these files and displays the web page to you. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes it interactive. Understanding this flow helps you see how HTML and CSS fit into web development.</p>

                    <h2>About topic</h2>
                    <p>HTML is responsible for structuring the content of a webpage. It organizes information into elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more. Each element is defined by tags, and browsers read these tags to display content properly. HTML creates the skeleton of a website, while CSS styles it, allowing developers to control how that content appears visually. CSS handles layout, colors, fonts, spacing, borders, responsiveness, and animations, making websites not just functional but also visually appealing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unlike scripting languages such as JavaScript or Python, HTML and CSS are not programming languages—they do not have logic, variables, or loops. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style language. Compared to WordPress or Wix, HTML and CSS provide greater control and flexibility, but require more technical knowledge. Modern alternatives to CSS include CSS preprocessors like SASS or LESS, which add features like variables and functions to CSS. However, standard CSS is still essential and forms the basis for these tools.

                    <p>Getting started with the actual documentation content. <em>This could come in a different color and font indicating lines of code.</em></p>
                    <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and layout of webpages. It defines various elements on a page using tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as for headings, for paragraphs, and  for images. These tags tell the web browser how to display and organize content. HTML serves as the foundation of all websites, forming a structured document that can be styled and made interactive using CSS and JavaScript respectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>HTML follows a hierarchical structure with nested elements, which makes it easy to divide a webpage into logical sections like headers, navigation bars, main content, and footers. It supports embedding multimedia elements like videos and audio, as well as forms for collecting user input. Modern HTML (HTML5) includes semantic elements to improve readability, accessibility, and SEO performance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>HTML is not a programming language—it doesn't support logic or decision-making like loops or conditions. Instead, it's purely structural. In comparison to website builders like Wix or WordPress, HTML offers greater flexibility and control, although it requires more manual coding. Every web developer, whether front-end or full-stack, must understand HTML as it forms the base layer of the web.</p>

                <section id="topic2">
                    <h2>Topic 2</h2>
                    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used to define the appearance and formatting of HTML elements on a webpage. While HTML provides the structure, CSS controls how that structure looks—setting properties such as color, font, size, spacing, alignment, borders, and layout. This separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) allows for cleaner code, easier maintenance, and reusability across multiple pages.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>CSS works by selecting HTML elements through selectors (element, .class, #id, etc.) and applying style rules using property-value pairs, such as color: red; or font-size: 18px;. CSS can be written inline within HTML elements, internally in a style tag, or externally in separate .css files. External stylesheets are widely preferred for maintaining large websites efficiently.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of CSS’s most powerful features is its support for responsive design. Using media queries, developers can ensure that webpages adjust to different screen sizes—from desktops to smartphones. CSS also supports Flexbox and Grid layouts, which simplify complex page structures. Additionally, CSS allows for transitions, animations, and hover effects that enhance user experience without the need for JavaScript.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When compared to tools like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, plain CSS offers more control and custom styling but may require more code. CSS preprocessors like SCSS and LESS extend the capabilities of vanilla CSS with features like variables and nesting, though they compile back into standard CSS. Regardless of which tools are used, understanding core CSS is essential for modern web design and development.</p>
